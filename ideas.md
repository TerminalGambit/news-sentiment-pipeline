# Agentic AI Feature Ideas

This file collects ambitious feature ideas for the Sentiment Analysis Agent. If you want to implement a new feature, start by reviewing and updating this file.

## A. Autonomous Sentiment Trend Watcher & Alert System
- Continuously monitor news sources for sentiment shifts or anomalies (e.g., sudden spike in negativity for a company or sector).
- Alert users (email, dashboard, Slack, etc.) and explain the likely cause (with links to articles).
- Optionally, summarize the news shift in plain English.

## B. Interactive Sentiment Explorer
- Users can ask questions in natural language (e.g., "Show me all negative news about Tesla in the last month.").
- The agent parses the query, fetches, analyzes, and visualizes the answer.
- Chat-style UI for follow-ups and drill-downs.

## C. Automated Investment/Market Insights Generator (**Selected for Implementation**)
- Analyze sentiment and correlate it with market data (stock prices, volumes, etc.).
- Generate actionable insights (e.g., "Sentiment for X has dropped sharply before previous price dips.").
- Simulate "what if" scenarios or backtest sentiment-based strategies.

## D. Personalized News & Sentiment Digest
- Users subscribe to topics, companies, or sectors.
- The agent delivers a personalized daily/weekly digest with sentiment analysis, key news, and trends.
- Include "explainers" for why sentiment changed.

## E. Agentic Research Assistant
- The agent can autonomously research a topic: scrape, summarize, analyze sentiment, and generate a report.
- Example: "What's the market sentiment on renewable energy in 2024?"
- Outputs a structured, referenced report with charts and key findings.
